Work in progress - yet another toolbox filled with offline-only tools. Useful for your everyday life and can turn your backup phone into a useful device.

None of the tools will require the internet.

This application is viewable at [Be-Prepared.github.io](https://be-prepared.github.io). It's a PWA and will be installable to your phone with a tap.

Also is an example of how to use [Fudgel](https://github.com/fidian/fudgel), an extremely lightweight web component library.
